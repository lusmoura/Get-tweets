# Get tweets

## Requirements

### Modules

To install all the requirements, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tokens

The only required token is the bearer token, that can be obtained through the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
With this token, create a .env file:

```
BEARER_TOKEN="<YOUR TOKEN>"
```

## Search Query

The query can be a single keyword, or a more advanced composition of search params.

**Pro Tip**

Use the twitter interface to create an Advanced Search query and use it in the code.
